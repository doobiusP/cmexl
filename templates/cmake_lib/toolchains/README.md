Contains toolchains for a variety of architectures and compilers across Linux and Windows.

Feel free to delete, edit or create new ones. The default presets provided by cmexl use these toolchains

Any changes here should be accounted for when using the default presets since they are not synced by default *(Eventually this will be possible)*
